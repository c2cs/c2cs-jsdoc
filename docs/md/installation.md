# Installation

Use NPM to install this library as a `devDependency` of your project:

```shell
[root@myproject project]# npm install --save-dev --save-exact c2cs-jsdoc
```

.. and, I'd love to write more .. but that's basically it.

Next, move on to the [Basic Usage](./basic-usage.md) documentation.
