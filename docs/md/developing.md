# Developing

This project implements a [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) development environment.
Vagrant allows developers running any major operating system to easily reproduce
specifically tailored development environments with a few simple commands.

You will need to ensure that Vagrant and Virtualbox are both installed before
continuing.
